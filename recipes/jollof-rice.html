    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups of long-grain rice</li>
      <li>1/4 cup of vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cups of blended tomatoes and peppers</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of thyme</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of curry powder</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>4 cups of chicken or vegetable broth</li>
      <li>Optional: diced vegetables (carrots, peas)</li>
      <li>Optional: protein (chicken, beef, or fish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear, then set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped
        onions and saut√© until translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the blended tomatoes and peppers to the pot, along with the tomato
        paste. Cook for about 10-15 minutes until the mixture thickens.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in the thyme, curry powder, and salt. Mix well.</li>
      <li>
        Add the rinsed rice to the pot and stir to coat the rice with the tomato
        mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, ensuring that the rice is fully
        submerged. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the pot and let it simmer for about 20-30 minutes, or until the
        rice is cooked and has absorbed all the liquid. Stir occasionally to
        prevent sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using, add diced vegetables and protein during the last 10 minutes of
        cooking.
      </li>
      <li>Once cooked, fluff the rice with a fork and serve hot.</li>
